# Generate-Faces-Project
In this project, I've used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate new images of faces.

## Architecture
The architecture was chosen as described in the initial DCGAN research paper [**Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
